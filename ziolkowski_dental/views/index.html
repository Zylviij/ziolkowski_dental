        <h2>Keith <small>Doctor</small></h2><img src="/img/keith.jpg" class="employee img-responsive pull-left img-rounded">
        <p>Dr. Ziolkowski is a life long resident of Milwaukee. He attended Marquette University High School, Marquette University, Marquette University Dental School and has been practicing at the same office since he graduated in 1982. In many ways he and his family of patients grew up together. Many remember him when he still had a lot more hair!</p>
        <p>Dr. Keith strongly believes that planing dental treatment should involve a discussion with his patients. He wants to know what is important to them; cosmetic concerns, pain, fear, past experiences. He believes that exceptional care only comes with exceptional knowledge. He is proud to have earned a Fellowship in the Academy of General Dentistry which requires 500 hours of continuing education and passing a 400 question exam. He is honored to be listed with American Top Dentists. He also believes in the importance of explaining things to patients. He knows that understanding treatment takes much of the fear out of it.</p>
        <p>Dr. Z also believes in community involvement. He supports the arts such as The Milwaukee Rep and The Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra. He has been the team dentist for the Milwaukee Admirals Hockey Team for over 25 years. He is married to Ancka (Anne) who works in the office and has two children, Blake and Remy. His favorite free time activity is traveling with his family, seeing new places, enjoying different cultures. Of all his titles his favorite and most important is 'Daddy'!</p>

        <p>Hi, my name is Dana. I have been a Dental Hygienist for 12 years. I began my career in a periodontal office which specializes in gum disease. In 2006 I had the pleasure of joining Ziolkowski Dental. It is great to spend my days working with such a kind and caring staff. My true joy comes from interacting with patients and providing the best oral health-care. It is very important to me to stay up to date with current technology and education.</p>
        <p>When I'm not at work I keep busy with my 18 year old son, Jaden. If I can find time for myself I enjoy relaxing with a good book.</p>

        <h2>Ancka <small>Office Manager</small></h2><img src="/img/ancka.jpg" class="employee img-responsive pull-left img-rounded">
        <p>Hi, I'm Anne (Ancka) and I've been here at the dental office for 25 years! I began my dental career at Marquette University School of Dentistry many years ago as a dental assistant. The first class of dental students I worked with was the class of 1982 - coincidentally the same year Keith was graduating. </p>
        <p>In April of 1989, I started working at the office, "love blossomed" and I became Mrs. Ziolkowski, It was not long after that, Keith and I began a family. While the kids were in grade-school, I worked part-time at the office, devoting many hours to volunteering at their grade school. Blake, our eldest, is now a junior at Marquette University High School. His passions are scuba diving, computer programming, sailing, and robotics. Remy is a freshman at Divine Savior Holy Angels and is loving life. Her loves are volleyball, beaches, and music. I am now back to working full-time as the Office Manager. When I'm not at the office, I am dreaming of beaches, sunshine, and planning a return trip to St. John in the USVI.</p>
        <p>During that span of time many changes have occurred at the office but several things remain constant. We have a wonderful family of patients who have been part of our lives for years. Many patients have grown up here and are now bringing their new families to our office. Secondly, we are fortunate to maintain a great staff to take care of all those wonderful people. It's truly a pleasure to work with such a dedicated and caring group of women! Last, but not least is Keith. Not all couples can enjoy working with their spouse but I love it.</p>

            <p> A bright and beautiful smile can give your confidence a boost. Your general dentist can perform a variety of cosmetic procedures to help you improve the look of your smile. Learn more about the cosmetic dentistry procedures that your dentist provides today! </p>
            <h5>
                What is cosmetic dentistry?
              </h5>
            <p> Cosmetic dentistry refers to any dental work that improves the appearance of a person's teeth, gums, or bite. </p>
            <h5>
                What are some common cosmetic procedures?
              </h5>
            <p> Common cosmetic procedures include bleaching, bonding, contouring and reshaping, crowns, and veneers. </p>
            <h5>
                Bleaching
              </h5>
            <p> Bleaching is a chemical procedure used to whiten teeth, which often become discolored over time. Some people have their teeth bleached to remove stains, while others simply want a brighter smile. Your dentist may perform bleaching in the office or provide you with an at-home bleaching kit to be used under his or her supervision. </p>
            <h5>
                Bonding
              </h5>
            <p> Bonding is the process of using a composite resin to fill in gaps between teeth or to whiten them. Bonding also may be used to correct chipped teeth or minor decay. The bonding procedure may be completed in a single office visit, and the results often last for several years, although some bonding resins are more susceptible to staining or chipping than other restoration materials. </p>
            <h5>
                Contouring and reshaping
              </h5>
            <p> Often combined with bonding, contouring and reshaping procedures are used to correct crooked, chipped, irregularly shaped, or overlapping teeth. Contouring and reshaping procedures can alter the teeth's length, shape, or position; contouring also can be used to improve bite. Contouring and reshaping procedures may be completed in a single visit and are ideal for patients with normal, healthy teeth who want subtle changes to their smiles. </p>
            <h5>
                Crowns
              </h5>
            <p> Also known as caps, crowns are placed over a tooth to create a normal appearance. Crowns can be used to restore fractured, misshapen, or discolored teeth, or those with significant structure loss. Crowns have a longer life expectancy than other cosmetic restorations, but they also are more expensive and time-consuming to place, requiring more than one office visit. Crowns are generally used in cases in which other cosmetic procedures would not be effective. </p>
            <h5>
                Veneers
              </h5>
            <p> Veneers are thin pieces of porcelain or plastic placed over the front of teeth to change their color or shape. In addition to improving teeth with uneven surfaces, veneers can be used to correct chipped, discolored, oddly shaped, unevenly spaced, or crooked teeth. Placement of veneers often requires more than one office visit, but they are less expensive than crowns and have better color stability and a longer life expectancy than bonding restorations. </p>
            <h5>
                Which procedure is right for me?
              </h5>
            <p> The condition of your teeth and your desired results will determine which cosmetic procedures are best for you. Your dentist can answer your questions and make recommendations on how best to improve your smile. </p>
