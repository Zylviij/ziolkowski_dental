					p Dr. Ziolkowski is a life long resident of Milwaukee.  He attended Marquette University High School, Marquette University, Marquette University Dental School and has been practicing at the same office since he graduated in 1982.  In many ways he and his family of patients grew up together.  Many remember him when he still had a lot more hair!
					p Dr. Keith strongly believes that planing dental treatment should involve a discussion with his patients.  He wants to know what is important to them; cosmetic concerns, pain, fear, past experiences.  He believes that exceptional care only comes with exceptional knowledge.  He is proud to have earned a Fellowship in the Academy of General Dentistry which requires 500 hours of continuing education and passing a 400 question exam.  He is honored to be listed with American Top Dentists. He also believes in the importance of explaining things to patients.  He knows that understanding treatment takes much of the fear out of it.
					p Dr. Z also believes in community involvement.  He supports the arts such as The Milwaukee Rep and The Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra. He has been the team dentist for the Milwaukee Admirals Hockey Team for over 25 years. He is married to Ancka (Anne) who works in the office and has two children, Blake and Remy.  His favorite free time activity is traveling with his family, seeing new places, enjoying different cultures.  Of all his titles his favorite and most important is 'Daddy'!

					p In April of 1989, I started working at the office, "love blossomed"  and I became Mrs. Ziolkowski,  It was not long after that, Keith and I began a family. While the kids were in gradeshcool, I worked part-time at the office, devoting many hours to volunteering at their grade school. Blake, our eldest, is now a junior at Marquette University High School. His passions are scuba diving, computer programming, sailing, and robotics. Remy is a freshman at Divine Savior Holy Angels and is loving life. Her loves are volleyball, beaches, and music. I am now back to working full-time as the Office Manager. When I'm not at the office, I am dreaming of beaches, sunshine, and planning a return trip to St. John in the USVI.
					p During that span of time many changes have ocurred at the office but serveral things remain constant.  We have a wonderful family of patients who have been part of our lives for years.  Many patients have grown up here and are now bringing their new families to our office.  Secondly, we are fortunate to maintain a great staff to take care of all those wonderful people.  It's truly a pleasure to work with such a dedicated and caring group of women!  Last, but not least is Keith.  Not all couples can enjoy working with their spouse but I love it.
